==========Realtime Aspect=========
-System uses timners and interupts to monitor the LDR

-Changes to the LDR guarantees a responses from the system
 within a reasonable amount of time

-In this case, when the LDR is covered, the enemy jumps
 back to a starting position on the LCD. If this happens while the 
 enemy is under the 3 blocks, the system updates the score
 and plays a tone over the speaker output device.

-All this occurs before the next timer interupt, which gives a chance
 for the player to remove their finger from the LDR

-As there is no lives lost for hitting the LDR to early, there is no
 significant consiquence for the system to miss this deadline, i.e.
 if the interupt again where to happen before the enemy moves back, it
 would just move back

-Since this motion is pradically instantaious, it is virtually impossible
 for the edge case to occur
